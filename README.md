# What is Logistics Regression 
A statistical method that models the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables (features). 
It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable.

# Why Logistics Regression
I selected Logistic Regression to predict the survival rate of Titanic passengers based on factors such as age, ticket class, and whether they had siblings aboard.

# The Dataset Breakdown
The sinking of the Titanic on April 15th, 1912, is one of the most tragic tragedies in history. The Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers. The numbers of survivors were low due to the lack of lifeboats for all passengers and crew. Some passengers were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and upper-class. This case study analyzes what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy. The dataset includes the following:

* Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Sex: Sex
* Age: Age in years
* Sibsp: # of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch: # of parents/children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket: Ticket number
* Fare: Passenger fare
* Cabin: Cabin number
* Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
* Target Class: Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
